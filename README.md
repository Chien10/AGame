# AGame

This repository contains a minimal Godot project. The main scene lets you move the root node using the arrow keys. The root node is a `CharacterBody2D` and its movement speed can be tweaked via the `speed` export variable in `player.gd`.

To run the project, open the folder in the Godot editor and start the `Main.tscn` scene.
